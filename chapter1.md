**Computer programming** is a way for people to provide precise instructions to computers. In business, people create standard processes and procedures to ensure work is performed efficiently, and likewise, people can create computer programs so computers can complete tasks effectively.

By viewing this course, you are benefitting from computer programs other people have created. For example, there are computer programs ensuring that each pixel in your computer screen is displaying the correct color to produce the image on the screen. When you move your mouse or trackpad, you see the cursor move on the screen because your computer contains computer programs that instruct it to reach to your mouse or trackpad movements. A key to identifying a computer program is to ask: "What/who is executing the instructions?" Computer programs are executed be computers or devices rather than human.

**Question** Which of the following is __NOT__ a computer program?

`@possible_answers`
- Microsoft Excel
- Instructions posted on the company intranet for uploading approval forms
- "Auto-Defrost" option on the microwave
- [Device driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver) for external microphone

`@feedbacks`
- That is a computer program. Software applications are computer programs.
- That is correct. Those instructions are performed by people who are uploading the approval forms.
- That is a computer program. The "Auto-Defrost" option contains instructions that are executed by the microwave when you select you.
- That is a computer program. Device drivers contain instruction that tell your computer how to work with the connected device.

The video is from another free online course hosted by DataCamp. If you would also like to enroll in that course follow this [link](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).

To summarize:
- Python is a general purpose programming language.
- Python is often used for data-related tasks ([data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)).
- Python is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), which means it is free for you to use.

**Question** True or False: To use Python, you must pay to optain a software license.

`@possible_answers`
- True
- False

`@feedbacks`
- That is incorrect. Python is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software).
- That is correct. Python is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software).

At this point, you have learned:
- You can create computer programs to provide instructions for your computer to execute.
- Python is the computer programming language you will be using in this course.

You may be asking yourself: How is this going to help me with my work?

Although many business cirriculums at many colleges do not include computer programming courses, many computer science students have started to learn business skills. One reason for this is the desire of many students to eventually create their own companies, but on a more general level, computer science skills can be applied to many different fields (including business). The best computer scientists are the ones who have expertise in their chosen domain in addition to having solid programming skills. As a business analyst, you are not only competing in the job market with your fellow business majors, but you are also competing with computer scientists who bring needed skillsets to the workplace.

There are many tasks you may be doing as a business analyst that would benefit from a computer science approach. One common example is data entry. Perhaps you may find yourself manually tranferring data from one spreadsheet to another. Although this repetitive task is mind-numbingly boring, it is essential because data needs to be in an understandable format such as a dashboard or report before people can analyze it and make decisions. One way to get out of doing this task is to hire interns who lack the experience to work on more important tasks. A less expensive option, is to create a computer program that automates this task. Chances are, if the computer task is repetitive with little variation, you can automate it with a computer program.

Through this course, you will learn Python skills that will allow you to automate common tasks. While learning these skills, you will also be introduced to new ways of thinking that will unlock new solutions to daily challenges you face. Although this course won't turn you into a full-fledged computer scientist, it will introduce basic computer science concepts that you will apply in your career.

**Question** True or False: Business Analysts can benefit from having basic computer science skills.

`@possible_answers`
- True correct one
- False

`@feedbacks`
- Good Job! [Here](https://blog.prototypr.io/beyond-code-why-you-should-learn-how-to-code-and-should-start-today-c7a544033f80) are some other reasons you may benefit from computer science!
